                <li><strong>Survey:</strong> Pain point with unclear date availability and price transparency</li>
                <li><strong>Competitive Benchmarking:</strong> Poor keyboard design, only group sizes of 1-2 can book online, confusing payment process</li>
                <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> Poor datepicker experience, lack of detail on room amenities, misleading images, unclear booking policies.</li>

            <p class="page-paragraph">
                Translate the research data into a structured format to inform the design of the booking process. This was achieved by mapping each stage of the booking process under the headings: User goals, behaviours, context, pain points, mental model and positives.
